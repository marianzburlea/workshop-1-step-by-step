You get all the free Firebase features (Analytics, Notifications, Crash Reporting, and so on) and generous amounts of our paid infrastructure features. However, if you exceed your Spark plan resources in a calendar month, your app will be shut off for the remainder of that month. In addition, Google Cloud Platform features are not available in the Spark tier.",
            "Our Flame plan is designed for early-stage startups and small- production apps looking for a predictable, low price but with more capacity than our free-tier offers for the Realtime Database, Storage, or Hosting resources. Like the Spark plan, Google Cloud Platform is not available on the Flame plan. Exceeding your plan resources in any month will cause your app to be shut off for the remainder of that month.",
            "Our Blaze plan is designed for large-scale production apps and apps that cannot accept downtime for exceeding plan limits. The Blaze plan also allows you to extend your app with paid Google Cloud Platform features. You pay only for the resources that you consume, allowing you to scale with demand. We strive to make our Blaze plan prices competitive with industry-leading cloud providers.",

            "This limit isn't the same as the total number of users of your app, because your users don't all connect at once. We encourage you to monitor your peak simultaneous database connections and upgrade if needed.",

          "answer": [
            "To provide you with a predictable price, the resources available to you in the Spark and Flame plans are capped. This means that when you exceed any plan limit in any month, your app will be turned off to prevent any further resource usage and additional charges.",
            "Usage is measured monthly, and if your app is disabled in a given month because of usage, it is automatically re-enabled at the beginning of the next month.",
            "We will attempt to notify you by email as you approach your resource limits. Of course, this may not be possible if a sudden spike in usage occurs. To avoid caps altogether, upgrade to the Blaze plan, which has no resource limits."
